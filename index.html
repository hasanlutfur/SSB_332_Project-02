<h1>Full Stack Web Development</h1>
<p>This webpage comprises the learning of Full Stack Web Development. Mentor is Mr. Minhaz Foysal. First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

<h2>Head</h2>
<p>In an HTML file, the html head is the first section in the code that contains information about a web page's properties and links to external related files. For example, in the HTML head, one can have the title of the page, meta tags, CSS code</p>

<h2>Body</h2>
<p>The "body" tag defines the document's body. The "body" element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, lists etc.</p>

<h2>Headings</h2>
<p>Headings define the outline of any site. There are six levels of headings. These are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 & h6. The higher the number, the less prominent the heading.</p>

<h2>Paragraph</h2>
<p>The "p" tag defines a paragraph.</p>

<h2>Element, Tag & Attribute</h2>
<p>Defination of element, tag & attributes are as follows</p>

<h3>Element</h3>
<p>An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML document. It represents semantics, or meaning. For example, the title element represents the title of the document. Most HTML elements are written with a start tag (or opening tag) and an end tag (or closing tag), with content in between.</p>

<h3>Tag</h3>
<p>An HTML code that defines every structure on an HTML page, including the placement of text and images and hypertext links. HTML tags begin with the less-than (<) character and end with greater-than (>). These symbols are also called "angle brackets,</p>

<h3>Attributes</h3>
<p>HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag to control the element's behaviour. HTML attributes are a modifier of an HTML element type.</p>

<h2>Lists</h2>
<p>This is the way one can make an unordered list</p>
<ul>
	<li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
	<li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
	<li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
</ul>

<p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
	<li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
	<li>Also one can see how the numbers increment on their own</li>
	<li>It is noticable that things are in precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
</ol>

<h2>Emphasis Element</h2>
<p><em>Sometimes,</em>one need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase. Here comes the element "em". It stands for “emphasis”, and it’s typically displayed as italicized text.</p>

<h2>Strong Element</h2>
<p>Other times one may need to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>

<h2>Images</h2>

<h2>Links</h2>
<p>There are two types of links</p>
<ul>
	<li>Internal Links</li>
	<a href="about.html" target="_blank">About</a>
	<li>External Links</li>
	<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hasan-lutfur-ab19b1206" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>
